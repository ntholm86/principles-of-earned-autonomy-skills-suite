# Session: retro-on-updated-vision

**Date:** 2026-05-02  
**Target:** autonomous-agent-skills  
**Operator:** Nils Holmager  
**Agent:** Claude Sonnet 4.6 (Anthropic, via GitHub Copilot)  
**Skill:** retrospect v1.5.0  
**Fidelity:** genuine — full arc read against updated vision; retrospect.md replaced; no findings manufactured  

---

## Context

Operator requested "retro on the updated vision." Vision.md had been substantially updated in the prior two entries of this session:
- `Vision: vision-competitive-framing` — added competitive framing, two explicit success conditions (research + adoption), learning falsification condition
- `intent v1.2.1` (d149c48) — added "Not Vision" cross-reference to Intent, closing a practitioner-discoverability asymmetry

The previous retrospect.md was dated 2026-05-02 (run: retrospect-second-real-pass-after-v3-16-0) — written before these vision updates.

## Arc read

**Scope:** Has the loop been attending to what the updated vision says matters — recognition claim, two-phase architecture, adoption success, trustworthy delegation research? Covering the full arc through the most recent entry.

**Key arc sequence reconstructed:**
- Runs 55–63 (2026-04-30): documentation convergence tail after v3.7.0 rename, v3.8.0 Hansei rewrite. Mechanical sweeps.
- Runs 64–68 (2026-05-01): structural design additions — Retrospect v1.0.0, retrospect.md/vision split, Vision v1.0.0, POSITION.md.
- Runs 69–71 (2026-05-01): Vision validated on operator vision, manifesto, position document.
- 2026-05-02 entries: Vision validated on vectorium (cold foreign target); major session v3.16.0 (Vision 3 targets, all writing skills .trail/ creation, Retrospect vision-first, first real Retrospect arc-read, retrospect.md updated); second Retrospect pass (GPT-5.3-Codex, compatible with first); occasion-independence experiment pass 1 (improve v3.7.0, structural change without topic injection).
- trail v1.10.0: sessions/ mandatory, both mechanical and rhetorical gaps fixed.
- Vision: vision-competitive-framing: vision.md updated with recognition claim, two success conditions, learning falsification.
- intent v1.2.1: "Not Vision" cross-reference added.

**Against updated vision:**

The vision introduces four elements since last retrospect.md:
1. Recognition claim — the differentiator test is instant recognition by practitioners who've felt the friction
2. Two-phase architecture — Phase 1 (vision convergence, not automatable) + Phase 2 (iterative loop)
3. Adoption success condition — developers use the skills in their own projects without the author's help
4. Learning falsification — done = future agent acts on a prior [!REALIZATION] rather than rediscovering it

**Arc against these four:**

*Recognition claim:* Loop has never tested this. Convergence runs test structural consistency. No mechanism in the loop generates practitioner recognition data. Phase 3 (outreach) is the only path. Not started.

*Two-phase architecture:* Phase 2 (the iterative loop) is what the entire arc has been doing. Vision is the Phase 1 mechanism and is validated (5 confirmations). But Phase 1 in the arc has always been operator-initiated. The occasion-independence experiment is the first data point of agent-initiated direction questions, but it was primed (same session as mechanism design). Cold Phase 1 initiation unobserved.

*Adoption success condition:* Trail v1.10.0 and the Intent "Not Vision" fix are discoverability improvements. But there's no mechanism to test whether a stranger can deploy the skills. External harness proof is the minimum bar. Not done.

*Learning falsification:* Defined precisely. Nearest case: operator-prompting [!REALIZATION] (runs 68, 71) → mechanism design (same session). May be "same context window" not "cross-session." No clear cross-session case in the arc.

## Six claims formed

1. Phase 1 has its first mechanism but remains operator-initiated in practice — Phase 1 cold initiation unobserved
2. Recognition + adoption introduce a validation gap no internal pass can close — Phase 3 not started
3. Trail v1.10.0 closes the longest-standing Observable Autonomy gap — soft enforcement only
4. Learning falsification defined but only one borderline case — cross-session case unobserved
5. Capability claims are evidence-grounded but thin — 5/4, 2/2, 2/2; d149c48 closes discoverability asymmetry
6. External harness proof is highest-urgency with two-sided urgency — not addressed by anything in queue

## retrospect.md written

Replaced .trail/retrospect.md. Key changes from prior retrospect.md:
- Prior retrospect.md: six claims focused on phase boundary, capability validation status, occasion-independence, manifesto relationship, external harness
- New retrospect.md: reoriented against updated vision — now names the recognition gap, two-phase architecture imbalance, adoption success gap, and learning falsification status explicitly
- Prior "what next" had several completed items crossed out; new retrospect.md strips those and focuses forward
- Loop-effectiveness notes: Phase 2 strong, Phase 1 cold initiation unproven, occasion-independence passes needed

## What I would do differently

The prior retrospect.md was written before the vision updates — it was current at the time. This retrospect.md replaces it with claims that can only be made after reading vision's new framing. A better workflow: every time vision.md changes substantially, Retrospect should run promptly. The gap here was about a session-boundary: vision was updated and this Retrospect run was triggered correctly, just slightly after the intent/Vision cross-reference fix that followed the vision update.
