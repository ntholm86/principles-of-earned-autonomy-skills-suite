# Session: retrospect-vectorium-arc-evidence-2026-05-02

**Date:** 2026-05-02  
**Skill:** retrospect v1.5.0  
**Target:** autonomous-agent-skills (`C:\Users\admin\.copilot\skills`)  
**Operator:** Nils Wendelboe Holmager (ntholm86)  
**Agent:** GitHub Copilot (Claude Sonnet 4.6 / Anthropic)  
**Fidelity:** Full — arc-read completed in full, retrospect.md replaced, trail entry written, session file written, commit+push pending

## Context

This Retrospect run was requested after 5 vectorium improvement runs across 2 sessions. The prior retrospect.md (retro-on-updated-vision, 2026-05-02 earlier) had 6 claims, with claim 4 (learning falsification) as "borderline case, no clear cross-session positive" and claim 6 (external harness proof) as "highest-urgency unvalidated claim." The operator asked whether 5 vectorium runs were enough to update the skills retrospect.md.

## What was read

- `vision.md` (step 0 — read first per retrospect v1.5.0)
- `retrospect.md` (prior version: retro-on-updated-vision)
- Full trail arc: the trail log entries from `retro-on-updated-vision` forward, covering:
  - `trail-v1-10-0-sessions-mandatory` — trail enforcement fix
  - `Vision-vision-competitive-framing` — vision updated with learning falsification condition
  - `external-proof-vectorium-improve-run` — first full Improve on vectorium (session 1)
  - `external-proof-vectorium-retrospect` — first Retrospect on vectorium, retrospect.md created (session 1)
  - `statemachine-tests-all-green` — vitest config fixed, 30/30 passing (session 2, this session)
  - `typed-scene-services` — 5 (any) casts removed, Scene services typed (session 2, this session)

## Arc-claims formed

6 claims written to retrospect.md. Key findings:

1. **Learning (claim 4)**: First clear cross-session case. Session 1's [!REALIZATION] on the (any) cast pattern was distilled into the vectorium retrospect.md queue. Session 2 acted on it without re-diagnosing. Vision's definition of learning is met.

2. **Observable Autonomy (claim 3)**: Validated in practice. The vectorium retrospect.md (written by session 1's Retrospect) successfully oriented session 2 before any code was examined. The inter-session memory mechanism worked end-to-end.

3. **External proof (claim 6)**: Gap narrowed but not closed. 5 runs, 2 sessions, learning carry-forward. Structural gap named precisely: operator = author in all vectorium runs. More vectorium runs cannot close the adoption success condition.

4. **Capability evidence (claim 5)**: Strengthened. All three skills (Vision, Improve, Retrospect) have multi-session, multi-run evidence on a real foreign target.

## Key [!REALIZATION]

The vectorium arc reveals a ceiling for the external-proof claim. Accumulating more runs on the same target (vectorium) with the same operator cannot close the adoption success condition regardless of how many correctness improvements are made. The single most leveraged next action is a run on a target the operator did not build.
