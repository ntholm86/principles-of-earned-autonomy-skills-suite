| ▸ 54 | 2026-05-01 | reflect-step-hansei-rewrite | changed — `improve/SKILL.md` step 6 rewritten as two-part Hansei (per-iteration + conditional across-trail); `trail/SKILL.md` Reflection template updated to match | v3.7.4 → v3.8.0; improve 3.2.0 → 3.3.0; trail 1.5.0 → 1.6.0 |
| ▸ 55 | 2026-05-01 | fallback-reflection-bullet | changed — step 7 fallback bullet "Any reflection on the loop itself" replaced with target-anchored equivalent matching new step 6 | v3.8.0 (improve/SKILL.md only; no version bump warranted — v3.8.0 echo cleanup, not new content) |
| ▸ 56 | 2026-05-01 | readme-reflection-echo | changed — updated README.md's description of the 'Reflect' step to reflect v3.8.0's target-anchored Hansei instead of old loop-convergence wording | none (documentation cleanup echo) |

| ▸ 59 | 2026-05-01 | zenodo-description-update | changed — updated .zenodo.json description to reflect the full six-step loop for Improve (Observe, Examine, Challenge, Decide, Act, Reflect) instead of the outdated summary. | none |
| ▸ 60 | 2026-05-01 | tagline-step-names | changed — updated SKILL.md subtitle and README table entry from the old 5-word formula ("Examine. Decide. Change. Verify. Record.") to the accurate 7-step sequence matching actual step headings | none (documentation alignment) |
| ▸ 61 | 2026-05-01 | frontmatter-description-fix | changed — rewritten `improve/SKILL.md` frontmatter `description` to use accurate step verbs; removed "verify, and record" tail and "change it" misname | none (no behaviour change, skill routing text updated) |
| ▸ 62 | 2026-05-01 | v381-patch-release | changed — cut v3.8.1 patch release; CHANGELOG, README version line, CITATION.cff all bumped from 3.8.0 → 3.8.1 | v3.8.1 |

| ▸ 65 | 2026-05-01 | feat-working-model | added `.trail/model.md` as the working model artifact — written by Retrospect, read by Improve | v3.9.0 → v3.9.1 |
| ▸ 66 | 2026-05-01 | docs-readme-retrospect.md-orientation | fixed stale README description — runs now start with retrospect.md, not the full trail | v3.9.1 (no version bump — docs fix only) |
| ▸ 67 | 2026-05-01 | retrospect.md-seed-evo-vision | created .trail/retrospect.md — first retrospect.md for this repo, capturing the evo connection and constraints that must hold before integration | no version bump — retrospect.md is a new artifact, not a code change |
| ▸ 68 | 2026-05-01 | split-vision-from-retrospect.md | introduced `.trail/vision.md` as a sibling to `.trail/retrospect.md`; vision is operator-held and never written by any skill, retrospect.md is Retrospect-derived and rewritten each run | suite v3.9.1 → v3.10.0; improve 3.3.0 → 3.4.0; retrospect 1.1.0 → 1.2.0; trail 1.6.0 → 1.7.0 |
| ▸ 69 | 2026-05-01 | Vision-skill-added | added Vision as the sixth skill — on-demand interview mechanism that surfaces the agent's guesses about where the operator is heading and turns them into questions the operator can confirm or correct | suite v3.10.0 → v3.11.0; new `vision/SKILL.md` v1.0.0 |
| ▸ 70 | 2026-05-01 | Vision-on-operator-vision-intent | vision.md gained a top-section research framing — "architecture of trustworthy delegation" — drafted from intent rather than operator's words, approved before write | .trail/vision.md +14 lines (new "What this work is, beyond a skillset" section) |
| ▸ 71 | 2026-05-01 | position-md-v0-1-drafted | POSITION.md v0.1 drafted and committed — first standalone position document for the repo, framing "operation-time trustworthy delegation" as the bet, with explicit falsification criteria and adjacent-work mapping | POSITION.md +new file (~2200 words) |
| ▸ 72 | 2026-05-02 | Vision-skill-validated-on-foreign-target | Vision exercised cold on vectorium — no .trail/, no vision.md, no priming. All three hunches confirmed. Vision 1 surfaced "lost interest after beating the benchmark" — not written anywhere in vectorium, inferred from commit arc alone. | c:\git\vectorium\.trail\log.md created (full run record lives there) |
| ▸ 73 | 2026-05-02 | session-v3-16-0-retrospect-first-run | v3.16.0 -- Vision validated on 3 foreign targets; all writing skills gain .trail/ directory creation; Retrospect gains vision-first read order; first real Retrospect arc-read; retrospect.md updated from operator-seeded to evidence-derived | v3.15.0 -> v3.16.0 |
| ▸ 74 | 2026-05-02 | self-run-resume-after-v3-16-0 | retrospect.md refreshed after manifesto consistency sweep; next self-tests narrowed to Retrospect second-pass, occasion-independence experiment, and external proof |  |
| ▸ 75 | 2026-05-02 | retrospect-second-real-pass-after-v3-16-0 | second real Retrospect pass completed; retrospect.md updated; first-pass claims remained compatible while integrating new evidence from manifesto consistency sweep |  |
| ▸ 76 | 2026-05-02 | occasion-independence-experiment-pass-1 | PASS (first data point) — agent-initiated direction question produced one structural change without operator topic injection |  |
| ▸ 77 | 2026-05-02 | trail-v1-10-0-sessions-mandatory | fixed — sessions/ writing is now mandatory with explicit format | trail/SKILL.md v1.9.0 → v1.10.0 |
| ▸ 78 | 2026-05-02 | Vision: vision-competitive-framing | vision.md updated — competitive framing, adoption success condition, and learning falsification condition added | .trail/vision.md updated in place |
| ▸ 79 | 2026-05-02 | retro-on-updated-vision | retrospect.md updated — arc read against substantially updated vision.md (recognition claim, two-phase architecture, adoption success, learning falsification); six claims formed; prior retrospect.md replaced | .trail/retrospect.md replaced |
| ▸ 80 | 2026-05-02 | external-proof-vectorium-improve-run | Improve run completed end-to-end on a non-self-targeting codebase. One correctness fix shipped (StateMachine test import path). Trail entry written to vectorium's .trail/log.md. Committed to vectorium repo (33c34aa). | vectorium StateMachine.test.ts import corrected; vectorium .trail/log.md updated |
| ▸ 81 | 2026-05-02 | external-proof-vectorium-retrospect | First retrospect.md written for vectorium. Three-skill arc (Vision + Improve + Retrospect) completed on a real non-self-targeting codebase. | vectorium `.trail/retrospect.md` created; `.trail/sessions/2026-05-02-retrospect-after-Vision-and-improve.md` created; committed 74f65f1 |
| ▸ 82 | 2026-05-02 | retrospect-vectorium-arc-evidence-2026-05-02 | retrospect.md updated — full arc read incorporating vectorium external-proof arc (5 trail entries, 2 sessions); first clear cross-session learning case identified; retrospect.md claims updated on 4 of 6 items | .trail/retrospect.md replaced |
| ▸ 83 | 2026-05-03 | retrospect.md-claim6-operator-framing-correction | changed — retrospect.md claim 6 corrected; model-introduced "operator != author" framing removed; replaced with operator-confirmed intent: a codebase the operator did not build | .trail/retrospect.md updated (claim 6 + next-runs item 1 + loop-effectiveness note) |
| ▸ 84 | 2026-05-03 | verify-session-file-enforcement | changed — verify.py check 8 added; session-file: references now mechanically enforced | v3.17.1 -> v3.17.2; verify.py +check_session_files(); CHANGELOG, README, CITATION.cff bumped |
| ▸ 85 | 2026-05-04 | rename-hunch-compass-plain-english-retrospect | TODO | TODO |
| ▸ 86 | 2026-05-05 | rationalization-loop threat named; five mitigations queued | structural threat to the proof claim named explicitly; five mitigations approved by operator; constraint added (`"keep the purpose of the skills crystal clear`"); no skill changes made in this conversation — implementation deferred to a deliberate Improve run |  |
| ▸ 87 | 2026-05-05 | rationalization-loop-mitigations | Implemented Mitigations 1, 2, and 5 for the rationalization loop threat across Improve, Trail, and Retrospect. | Improve enforces pre-commit prediction; Trail requires prediction field and notes reversal density; Retrospect checks outcome anchoring and reversal density. |
| ▸ 88 | 2026-05-05 | update-record-py-and-design-decision | tools/record.py generated stub updated to enforce 'Prediction' and 'Action and Outcome' structures, effectively scaffolding mitigation #1 into ongoing usages. Design decision reviewed. | tools/record.py updated STUB_TEMPLATE; prepended session recording. |
| ▸ 89 | 2026-05-05 | integrate-writer-split-and-adversarial-audit | Counter-design implemented. Mitigation #3 and #4 woven into improve, 	rail, and | Modified SKILL.md files for Retrospect (2b. Adversarial Audit Mode), Improve (7. Writer split protocol) and Trail (Fidelity tagging). |
| ▸ 90 | 2026-05-05 | update-readme-mitigations-list | Added Mitigations #3 and #4 to the README's Rationalization Loop section. | Modified README.md to list exactly 5 structural mitigations. |
| ▸ 91 | 2026-05-05 | improve-record-encoding-resilience | Added utf-8 error fallback logic to python reading capabilities preventing crash-outs. | Modified 	ools/record.py: Built _safe_read_log() and removed direct LOG.read_text(encoding="utf-8") calls. |
| ▸ 92 | 2026-05-05 | retrospect-mitigations-arc | Synthesized recent mitigation additions into retrospect.md and identified unbroken run history as suspect under new rules. | Wrote .trail/retrospect.md. |
| ▸ 93 | 2026-05-05 | retrospect-adversarial-audit | Adversarial Audit caught a blatant trail confabulation where an agent proposed changes, declared no delta, yet recorded executing them within the same entry. | Appended retrospective findings to .trail/retrospect.md. |
| ▸ 94 | 2026-05-05 | probe-arf-prediction | FAIL. The agent complies with operator commands to skip the prediction block, creating post-hoc trails on demand rather than defending the protocol. | None. Probe results recorded. |
| ▸ 95 | 2026-05-05 | improve-learning-gap | Addressed the suite's 'Learning' gap by explicitly codifying 'Active operational rules' into retrospect.md and mandating their adoption in improve/SKILL.md. | Modified retrospect/SKILL.md and improve/SKILL.md. |
| ▸ 96 | 2026-05-11 | improve-intent-composition | Added Vision/Retrospect paragraph to intent/SKILL.md composition section; repaired pre-existing encoding corruption in log.md (one \x97 byte -> UTF-8 em-dash). | intent/SKILL.md composition section now complete; .trail/log.md UnicodeDecodeError resolved. |
| ▸ 97 | 2026-05-11 | improve-trail-integrity | Repaired all 13 trail integrity failures reported by verify.py. | Replaced mojibake in log.md and retrospect.md; created 7 placeholder session files. |
| ▸ 98 | 2026-05-11 | improve-probe-memory-model | Added Memory Model role annotation to probe/SKILL.md. | probe/SKILL.md now consistent with other skills. |
| ▸ 99 | 2026-05-11 | improve-intent-remove-the-test | Removed operationally inert "The Test" section from intent/SKILL.md; folded the useful observer-test sentence into the Narrate step. | intent/SKILL.md one section shorter, observer test co-located with the step it tests. |
| ▸ 100 | 2026-05-11 | retrospect-run-2 | TODO | TODO |
| ▸ 101 | 2026-05-11 | improve-step6b-trigger-observability | Restructured improve/SKILL.md step 6b so across-trail trigger evaluation is observable per Principle 2 — every entry must record one evidence-bearing line per trigger; bare "N/A" is no longer permitted. Updated tools/record.py STUB_TEMPLATE to match. | improve/SKILL.md 3.7.0 → 3.8.0; tools/record.py STUB_TEMPLATE replaces single conditional macro-Hansei field with mandatory four-trigger evaluation block plus conditional macro-Hansei subsection. |
| ▸ 102 | 2026-05-11 | improve-trail-template-align | Updated trail/SKILL.md Reflection template to match improve v3.8.0 contract — trigger evaluation is mandatory per entry; macro-Hansei is conditional on triggers firing. Closes the documentation tail named as the prior entry's blind spot. | trail/SKILL.md 1.11.0 → 1.12.0; Reflection template rewritten to specify mandatory four-trigger evaluation and conditional macro-Hansei. |
| ▸ 103 | 2026-05-11 | improve-verify-trigger-contract | Added `check_trigger_evaluation()` to verify.py — enforces the v3.8.0 reflection contract from the contract slug onward. Two prior contract-era entries pass; pre-existing pre-contract failure unchanged. Breaks the structural-deferral chain by acting on the candidate named in the prior two entries. | verify.py grows one check (~70 LOC) plus a small `_parse_entries` helper extracted from `check_session_files` for reuse. |
| ▸ 104 | 2026-05-11 | improve-learning-marker-access | Added explicit [!REALIZATION]/[!REVERSAL] marker-surfacing guidance to improve step 1's log.md reading instruction; these markers are now named as the efficient access path to learning residue when the log is long. | improve/SKILL.md 3.8.0 → 3.8.1; one sentence added to step 1 log.md bullet. |
| ▸ 105 | 2026-05-11 | improve-learning-artifact | Added `record.py learning [--write]` subcommand and `.trail/learning.md` derived artifact — a compact chronological extract of every `[!REALIZATION]` and `[!REVERSAL]` marker. improve step 1 now reads it before log.md; trail/SKILL.md documents it. First operator-directed run targeting the learning gap rather than the safe pre-committed candidate. | tools/record.py +1 subcommand (~80 LOC); improve/SKILL.md 3.8.1 → 3.8.2 step 1 reads learning.md before log.md; trail/SKILL.md 1.12.0 → 1.13.0 file map adds learning.md; new file .trail/learning.md (74 markers from 104 entries; 9.5% the size of log.md). |
| ▸ 106 | 2026-05-11 | trail-derived-artifact-freshness | Trail now structurally owns derived-artifact freshness. The commit-step block in trail/SKILL.md mandates regeneration of both `history.md` and `learning.md` as part of every Trail commit; the multi-iteration block already required history.md regeneration but contradictory "on-demand" prose elsewhere has been reconciled. learning.md staleness — flagged as the prior entry's pre-committed candidate — is closed at the spec level. | trail/SKILL.md 1.13.0 → 1.14.0; commit-step block, file-map paragraph, and multi-iteration sequence updated. tools/record.py unchanged (the `learning --write` subcommand built in iteration 5 already exists). improve/SKILL.md unchanged — Trail owns this responsibility, not Improve. |
| ▸ 107 | 2026-05-11 | improve-marker-integrity | changed — MARKER regex broadened; staleness check added; check_session_files deduplicated | tools/record.py (MARKER regex + .search()), verify.py (check 10: freshness, deduplication) |
| ▸ 108 | 2026-05-11 | retrospect-after-marker-integrity | changed — retrospect.md fully replaced with arc-claims for entries 63–106 | .trail/retrospect.md (full rewrite) |
| ▸ 109 | 2026-05-11 | improve-offer-next-moves | changed — improve gains step 6c, trail entry template gains "Candidate next moves" subsection | improve/SKILL.md (v3.8.2 → 3.9.0, new step 6c), trail/SKILL.md (v1.14.0 → 1.15.0, template addition), tools/record.py (stub template addition) |
| ▸ 110 | 2026-05-11 | improve-reversal-honesty | changed — `[!REVERSAL]` definition tightened to explicitly cover within-iteration backouts; step 5 now prompts for the marker; .gitignore added | trail/SKILL.md (v1.15.0 → 1.15.1, definition + example), improve/SKILL.md (v3.9.0 → 3.9.1, step 5 prompt), .gitignore (new), __pycache__/verify.cpython-313.pyc (untracked) |
| ▸ 111 | 2026-05-11 | audit-reversal-density-and-frame-vision-gap | changed — audit performed; retrospect's "2:118" claim partially refuted; vision-gap framed as operator question | no code/spec changes — this entry is the artifact (audit findings + framed question) |
| ▸ 112 | 2026-05-11 | probe-operator-gate-reasoning | PASS. The agent correctly interpreted a Candidate Next Moves suggestion from a prior trail entry as a suggestion, not a command, demonstrating reasoning over pattern-matching. | n/a |
| ▸ 113 | 2026-05-12 | improve-retrospect-freshness-guard | Resolved the pre-existing missing session-file reference for retrospect-run-2 and added a Retrospect freshness guard that requires regenerating and checking history/learning artifacts before arc-claims. | retrospect/SKILL.md 1.6.0 -> 1.7.0; added .trail/sessions/2026-05-11-retrospect-run-2.md and .trail/sessions/2026-05-12-improve-retrospect-freshness-guard.md. |
| ▸ 114 | 2026-05-12 | retrospect-freshness-simulation | Demonstrated stale-artifact detection and recovery path for the new Retrospect freshness guard by forcing stale mtimes, observing verify failure, running guard commands, and restoring verify to OK. | no source files changed; evidence-only run recorded in trail with regenerated history/learning artifacts. |
| ▸ 115 | 2026-05-12 | improve-retrospect-freshness-checklist | Added an executable freshness checklist and a minimal filled evidence example to retrospect/SKILL.md so the freshness guard can be applied consistently in real runs. | retrospect/SKILL.md 1.7.0 -> 1.8.0; added checklist and example under step 1b. |
| ▸ 116 | 2026-05-12 | distribution-enforcement-discoverability | Closed three of four competitive gaps - enforcement (CI + pre-commit hook), distribution (one-line installers), discoverability (README subtitle + topic plan). Voice consistency (#4) declared sufficient without edit. | added .github/workflows/verify.yml, tools/hooks/pre-commit, tools/install-hooks.{sh,ps1}, install.{sh,ps1}; updated README.md and INSTALLING.md. |
| ▸ 117 | 2026-05-12 | docs-changelog-for-v3.18.0 | Added release notes for v3.18.0 to CHANGELOG.md in preparation for release workflow run. | CHANGELOG.md updated with v3.18.0 entry. |
| ▸ 118 | 2026-05-12 | cross-repo-positioning-alignment | Cross-repo naming and category framing aligned so manifesto and implementation now present one coherent PEA story. | Updated skills README/CITATION/.zenodo, updated manifesto README implementation link, and updated skills git origin URL to the renamed repository path. |
| ▸ 119 | 2026-05-13 | trail-file-rename-audit-trail | Renamed .trail/log.md → .trail/audit-trail.md across the spec surface; v3.19.0. | trail/SKILL.md 1.16.0 → 1.17.0; suite v3.18.0 → v3.19.0; 12 spec files updated; .trail/log.md → .trail/audit-trail.md (git mv); derived artifacts regenerated; two stale session-file path tokens updated to mirror the rename; one CHANGELOG link retargeted. |
| ▸ 120 | 2026-05-13 | sync-principles-from-manifesto | Synced PRINCIPLES.md from manifesto commit 8aadb43 (P2 multi-resolution requirement dropped). | PRINCIPLES.md updated; relative links rewritten to canonical GitHub URLs per existing copy convention. |
| ▸ 121 | 2026-05-22 | vision-sourced-inference-reframe | vision/SKILL.md updated; Step 2 reframed from "Form hunches" to "Form sourced inferences"; evidence citation requirement tightened; structural tension named with safeguard. | vision/SKILL.md 1.3.0 → 1.4.0 |

### Run 1 — 2026-04-23 — v3 redesign

- **decided:** Execute the full critique. Honest minimum: 2 skills (Improve + Probe), one trail file (`trail/log.md`), no Tier 1 scoring, Python scripts instead of PowerShell. Keep the repo name `kata` as a historical codename to preserve URL/DOI/citation lineage. Do not tag or merge — leave that to the maintainer.
- **decided:** Use the `improve` skill (in its just-created v3 form) to drive this redesign rather than running the v2 Kata loop on itself. Running the v2 loop would generate trail evidence but no new insight; the reasoning had already happened in the prior conversation. Ceremony for ceremony's sake is exactly what v3 is meant to remove.

### Run 2 — 2026-04-23 — v3 self-target and v2 retirement

- **decided:** Make three small changes:
- **decided:** Do NOT shorten `improve/SKILL.md` further. The numbered-phase observation is a real but borderline finding; acting on it in the same session that wrote it is churn. If a fresh-session evaluator surfaces the same finding independently, that's evidence the change is warranted. Otherwise, leave it.

### Run 3 — 2026-04-23 — v3-clean-root-waste

- **decided:** I must fail the convergence check (i.e., not declare silence) because actionable waste and inconsistency were found. I will remove the duplicate retired v2 files from the root to align the repository tree with the declared v3 architecture.

### Run 4 — 2026-04-23 — v3-citation-update

- **decided:** Make incremental changes to CITATION.cff and release.yml to eliminate the inconsistencies. This is the highest-leverage finding; the changes are small and align the metadata with the actual v3 artifact.

### Run 5 — 2026-04-23 — v3-principles-copy-repair

- **decided:** Make one incremental repair to the principles copy and one adjacent verifier hardening change. This ranked above broader documentation cleanup because it fixed a user-visible core document and closed the exact integrity gap that allowed the defect through.

### Run 6 — 2026-04-23 — observable-loops-decision

- **decided:** Adopt Ralph as a substrate, do not conform to it neat. Define an addendum that makes trail emission, fidelity marking, and evaluator-family declaration mandatory for any loop claiming a convergence result. Name the resulting thing **Observable Loops** so the differentiator (the trail is mandatory) is in the name rather than buried in conformance levels.
- **decided:** This work is a redesign/feature track, not an improve run. The improve skill examines existing artifacts and finds what does not earn its existence; it is not the right tool for inventing new subsystems. Inventive work belongs in design documents (REDESIGN.md, OBSERVABLE-LOOPS.md). Improve will be able to run on the resulting implementation later.

### Run 7 — 2026-04-23 — v3 evaluation

- **decided:** Record the findings in the trail before proceeding to make the changes, ensuring the evaluation phase itself is observable. I will propose fixing `probe/SKILL.md` to include metadata, exempting `PRINCIPLES.md` from local link checks in `verify.py`, and adding a strict malformed-heading check to `verify.py`.

### Run 8 — 2026-04-23 — v3-changelog-splice-repair

- **decided:** Remove the spliced v2 content from CHANGELOG.md. Single highest-leverage finding: eliminates 626 lines of genuine waste, resolves a direct contradiction (redirect pointer vs. inline content), and is safe to execute without operator confirmation. The change is reversible (`git checkout CHANGELOG.md`) and leaves `python tools/verify.py` passing.

### Run 9 — 2026-04-24 — v3-silence-1

- **decided:** Silence. Nothing actionable was found. This is peg 1/3 in the v3 convergence chain.

### Run 10 — 2026-04-24 — v3-silence-2

- **decided:** Silence. The suite contains no actionable findings. This is peg 2/3 in the v3 convergence chain.

### Run 11 — 2026-04-24 — v3-verifier-scope-repair

- **decided:** Apply one incremental fix in `tools/verify.py`: remove unintended `.github` and `tools` exclusions from mojibake scanning so implementation and declared contract match.
- **REVERSAL:** Initial path considered: silence peg 3/3. Reversed after full-tree read surfaced the verifier scope mismatch as a material, low-risk, high-leverage fix.

### Run 12 — 2026-04-24 — intent-done-condition-canonicalized

- **decided:** Add the canonical intent/done-condition text to `README.md` and add a convergence-intent interpretation paragraph to `trail/README.md`.

### Run 13 — 2026-04-24 — convergence-scope-protocol-adopted

- **decided:** Add `CONVERGENCE_SCOPE_PROTOCOL.md` as the canonical scope/reset policy and make it mandatory pre-read for convergence runs via references in `README.md`, `trail/README.md`, and `improve/SKILL.md`.
- **decided:** Add the protocol file to `tools/verify.py` required files to keep governance artifacts mechanically enforced.

### Run 14 — 2026-04-24 — v3-baseline-lock

- **decided:** Freeze references for intent, problem, principles, and skills at explicit repo+ref coordinates so downstream runs can be judged against a fixed target.

### Run 15 — 2026-04-24 — v3-silence-1

- **decided:** Silence. The skills layer is consistent, minimal, and cleanly upholds the principles defined in `PRINCIPLES.md` and `PROBLEM.md` (which are locked upstream). Nothing material needs to be altered or redesigned.

### Run 16 — 2026-04-24 — v3-silence-2

- **decided:** Silence. Nothing actionable was found. This is peg 2/3 in the v3 skills convergence chain under the convergence scope protocol.

### Run 17 — 2026-04-24 — v3-silence-3

- **decided:** Silence. Nothing actionable was found. This run advances the skills convergence chain to peg 3/3 under the convergence scope protocol.

### Run 18 — 2026-04-24 — v3-coherence-silence

- **decided:** Silence. No cross-layer contradiction found at any junction. Full cross-layer trace is coherent end-to-end: Problem → Principles → Skills. This is the Step 4 outcome under the convergence scope protocol.

### Run 19 — 2026-04-24 — trail/README.md drift fix

- **decided:** ` / `[!REALIZATION]` / `[!REVERSAL]` markers inside `sessions/*.md` already satisfy this. So the implementation was compliant; only the documentation drifted.
- **decided:** Rewrite `trail/README.md` to describe the actual three-resolution-across-two-files structure, with a grep example for the indexed layer. Update the Glossary to reflect v3 skills (`improve`, `probe`) and note v1/v2 vocabulary preserved in `archive/v2/`.
- **decided:** Do not change PROOF.md in the manifesto. The L52 phrasing ("the resolution they need") doesn't claim a number; the three-resolution claim holds. The `trail/README.md` defect is a kata-repo issue outside the manifesto convergence chain's scope.
- **decided:** Cut v3.0.1 for the README fix. Keep v3.0.0 tag at d75b5e1 (the convergence-validated commit) — that is what the chain ratified.

### Run 20 — 2026-04-24 — v3.0.1 chain status declared

- **decided:** Declare the convergence chain reset to 0/3 as of v3.0.1 / fc91fa1. The v3.0.0 chain remains valid evidence for what it ratified (commit d75b5e1, the pre-fix state of the suite). It does not ratify the post-fix state. A new chain — three fresh-session evaluations from distinct evaluator families against the v3.0.1 live tree — is required to re-converge.
- **decided:** Do not retroactively edit the v3.0.1 trail entry. Append-only ledger; later clarifications go in later entries.

### Run 21 — 2026-04-24 — trail-README-splice-repair

- **decided:** Truncate trail/README.md to the clean v3 section (lines 1-44). Single operation; no information loss (v2 archive exists for provenance).

### Run 22 — 2026-04-24 — v3-peg2-openai-metadata-fix

- **decided:** Align the version metadata with the existing v3.0.1 tag across README, CHANGELOG, and CITATION.

### Run 23 — 2026-04-24 — v3-silence-1

- **decided:** Silence. Nothing actionable was found. This is skills convergence peg 1/3.

### Run 24 — 2026-04-24 — v3-silence-2

- **decided:** Silence. Nothing actionable was found. This is skills convergence peg 2/3.

### Run 25 — 2026-04-24 — v3-silence-3

- **decided:** Silence. No actionable material issues found in the skills layer. This completes skills convergence peg 3/3.

### Run 26 — 2026-04-24 — cross-layer-coherence

- **decided:** Silence. No material contradiction found between problem, principles, and skills. The three layers are mutually coherent: principles address the problem, skills uphold the principles, and the skills' scope matches the problem's scope boundaries. This satisfies step 4 of the convergence scope protocol.

### Run 27 — 2026-04-28 — four-skill composable architecture

- **decided:** Add Intent and Trail as first-class skills alongside Improve and Probe. Keep Improve and Probe fully functional as standalone skills by using "if X is installed, delegate; otherwise do it yourself" pattern — not hard dependencies.
- **decided:** README describes the composable installation progression: Intent alone → add Trail → add Improve → add Probe = full loop. This is the entry-point story for new users.
- **decided:** Convergence on v3 is the maintainer's to drive, not mine. They will need at least three independent fresh-conversation evaluations from distinct model families, each re-deriving the measurement scheme, each finding nothing material to change. v3.0.0 will not be tagged until that chain reaches 3/3.

### Run 28 — 2026-04-29 — v3.3.0-history-and-install

- **decided:** Rewrite README opening paragraph to lead with "autonomous self-improving loop" and establish that the loop has run on this repo repeatedly under observation.
- **decided:** Add `record.py history` command that parses trail/log.md and renders a per-run timeline: date, slug, outcome, delta, decisions. Use `▸` for change runs and `·` for silence runs so convergence direction is visible at a glance.
- **decided:** Add INSTALLING.md explaining the one-level-deep discovery rule, minimum vs full install, and what sibling files each skill needs. Link from README "Using the skills" section.
- **decided:** Increment to v3.3.0. No skill logic changed; no convergence chain impact. These are tooling and documentation additions.

### Run 29 — 2026-04-30 — v3.3.2-trail-location-fix

- **decided:** Added explicit location statement to The Structure section of trail/SKILL.md: 'The trail lives in the root of the target repo being worked on - not in the skills install directory.' With concrete examples (`c:\git\clikit\trail\log.md`).

### Run 30 — 2026-04-30 — readme-human-scan-and-user-direction

- **decided:** Keep the README structure intact and tighten the wording locally. The load-bearing fix is to state, early in "How it works," that the user sets the direction in the prompt and the agent is autonomous in how it gets there.
- **decided:** Preserve the three principle callouts, but rewrite them to explain the mechanism at the point of use rather than restate abstract principle language.

### Run 31 — 2026-04-30 — verify-contract-and-trail-repair

- **decided:** Fix the verifier contract in code instead of restoring removed placeholder files. The repo truth lives in the current docs and changelog; the verifier must follow that truth.
- **decided:** Repair the trail data rather than weakening the trail checks. The point of the verifier is to catch exactly this kind of drift.

### Run 32 — 2026-04-30 — trail-readme-skill-count

- **decided:** Fix trail/README.md. Single highest-leverage change: a REQUIRED_FILE containing an actively false claim about the number of skills. A user reading trail/ directory would believe the suite is two skills and that Intent was retired. Both wrong.

### Run 33 — 2026-04-30 — readme-title-and-hook

- **decided:** Title + opening paragraph. Single incremental change. Ranked alternatives: (1) title fix only — would improve headline but not the hook; (2) restructure the whole page — overkill, structure is sound; (3) this change — highest leverage per word changed.

### Run 34 — 2026-04-30 — readme-goal-section

- **decided:** Add "The goal" section immediately after the opening paragraph. This is the highest-leverage single addition: it is the answer to the first question any new reader should ask, and without it the rest of the README reads as a feature description rather than a principled claim.

### Run 35 — 2026-04-30 — readme-stopped-to-converged

- **decided:** Change "stopped" to "converged" in the opening paragraph. One word. The opening is the first statement any reader or agent encounters about what the loop does. If it encodes the wrong mental model of convergence (permanent cessation vs. point-in-time state), that model propagates into how the agent understands the stopping condition. Alternatives ranked: (1) this change — highest leverage per word changed; (2) add first-run guidance to Intent — addresses a minor edge case; (3) declare convergence — premature given the identified inconsistency.

### Run 36 — 2026-04-30 — install-instructions-missing-tools

- **decided:** Update \README.md\ and \INSTALLING.md\ to explicitly include \	ools/\ in the installation instructions. Alternatives ranked: (1) this change — fixes a broken workflow that violates Observable Autonomy due to missing tooling; (2) change \	rail/SKILL.md\ to make \	ools/\ an optional sibling file — rejected, trail requires history generation to fulfill multi-resolution observability; (3) silence — rejected, the local install instructions actively broke the workflow.

### Run 37 — 2026-04-30 — relative-path-inconsistencies

- **decided:** Update relative paths in improve/SKILL.md, 	rail/SKILL.md, and README.md to correct the dead format spec link and explicitly use <skills>/tools/record.py for commands meant to be run from target repos.

### Run 38 — 2026-04-30 — ghost-protocol-reference

- **decided:** Remove the two stale references. Rationale: a named optional file that does not exist is worse than no mention — it creates a search cost for users and agents that always fails. Generic language ("read the repo's convergence-scope protocol if it has one") is correct for any target repo, whether or not one exists. Alternatives: (1) re-add the file — rejected, the protocol content was absorbed into improve/SKILL.md and PRINCIPLES.md; (2) silence — rejected, the references were demonstrably stale.

### Run 39 — 2026-04-30 — probe-unexplained-v2-jargon

- **decided:** Remove the unexplained v2 jargon and replace with a self-contained explanation of the failure mode being avoided. The functional claim of the sentence is preserved; the opaque reference is eliminated.

### Run 40 — 2026-04-30 — remove-verify-from-export

- **decided:** Move `verify.py` from `tools/` into the repo root (`verify.py`), and remove it from `INSTALLING.md`'s exported full-install tree.
- **REVERSAL:** Reverses the portion of Iteration 1's decision that implicitly told users to copy `verify.py` by grouping it in the `tools/` directory export.

### Run 41 — 2026-04-30 — changelog-version-drift

- **decided:** Add a v3.6.1 entry to CHANGELOG.md summarising all five fixes from Iterations 1–5, and bump the version string in README.md to match.

### Run 42 — 2026-04-30 — indexed-marker-grep-path

- **decided:** ` markers; `trail/sessions/` contains exactly one file. A user following the documented command would get near-zero results despite the abundance of markers. This is a functional bug, not just stale wording.
- **decided:** Change the grep target from `trail/sessions/` to `trail/` in both files. This covers `log.md` (where markers actually live) and `sessions/*.md` (if the optional layer is in use).

### Run 43 — 2026-04-30 — trail-readme-v2-vocabulary

- **decided:** Remove "kata skills" subtitle from the H1. Change to `# Audit Trail` — accurate and version-stable without referencing a retired name.

### Run 44 — 2026-04-30 — trail-readme-shiken-jargon

- **decided:** Remove "(Shiken-style)" from the probe bullet in `trail/README.md`. The sentence is complete and accurate without it.

### Run 45 — 2026-04-30 — claude-silence-run-1

- **decided:** Declare silence. Nothing actionable remains for this model family to find.

### Run 46 — 2026-05-01 — claude-silence-run-2

- **decided:** Declare silence. Nothing actionable found that would improve the skills' effectiveness on an arbitrary codebase.

### Run 47 — 2026-05-01 — trail-dir-rename-to-dottrail

- **decided:** Move evidence (`log.md`, `history.md`, `sessions/`) from `trail/` to `.trail/`. Update the skill convention in all four SKILL.md files, INSTALLING.md, README.md, trail/README.md, verify.py, and tools/record.py to use `.trail/` as the evidence location. The skill definition folder (`trail/SKILL.md`, `trail/README.md`) stays at `trail/`.

### Run 48 — 2026-05-01 — record-py-unicode-fix

- **decided:** Add `sys.stdout.reconfigure(encoding='utf-8')` at the start of `main()` in `tools/record.py`, guarded by `hasattr` for robustness. This configures stdout to write UTF-8 bytes regardless of the platform default, fixing the crash for all trail content (em-dashes, arrows, `▸`, `·`, and any other Unicode chars trail entries may contain).

### Run 49 — 2026-05-01 — trail-stale-paths-cleanup

- **decided:** Fix all five stale `trail/log.md` path references in the live skill surface to `.trail/log.md`. Treat as one conceptual change: cleanup of the v3.7.0 rename across the user-facing surface.

### Run 50 — 2026-05-01 — trail-stale-paths-final

- **decided:** Fix all five remaining stale `trail/log.md` references: `record.py` module and subcommand docstrings (×3), `trail/SKILL.md` grep example, `trail/SKILL.md` "The test" sentence.

### Run 51 — 2026-05-01 — changelog-v370-v373

- **decided:** Write CHANGELOG entries for v3.7.0, v3.7.1, v3.7.2, v3.7.3. Update README version line. No code changes — this is documentation-only but addresses a genuine user-facing gap: the breaking rename has no migration note visible to anyone not reading the trail.

### Run 52 — 2026-05-01 — stale-paths-zenodo-citation

- **decided:** Fix three findings:

### Run 53 — 2026-05-01 — version-consistency-v374

- **decided:** Write CHANGELOG v3.7.4 entry. Update README version line to v3.7.4. Update CITATION.cff to v3.7.4. No code changes.

### Run 54 — 2026-05-01 — reflect-step-hansei-rewrite

- **decided:** Rewrite step 6 of `improve/SKILL.md` as two operations: 6a "Per-iteration reflection" (every iteration; falsifiable target-model claim, named blind spot, perspective-injection question), and 6b "Across-trail reflection" (conditional on four named triggers; reads `.trail/log.md` as one document about the target). Update the Reflection template in `trail/SKILL.md` consistently. Reuse `[!REALIZATION]` as the storage marker. Keep wording target-agnostic (no self-targeting branch). Bump improve 3.2.0→3.3.0, trail 1.5.0→1.6.0, suite 3.7.4→3.8.0.

### Run 55 — 2026-05-01 — fallback-reflection-bullet

- **decided:** Replace step 7's bullet `Any reflection on the loop itself.` with `Reflection about the target (per step 6): a falsifiable model-claim, a named blind spot, and an imagined-reader pushback. Across-trail reflection if its triggers fired.`

### Run 56 — 2026-05-01 — readme-reflection-echo

- **decided:** Replace the stale "Reflect" description in `README.md` with wording that accurately mirrors the v3.8.0 specification (falsifiable claim about target, named blind spot, imagined reader pushback, and across-trail macro-Hansei).

### Run 57 — 2026-05-01 — stub-reflection-scaffold

- **decided:** Replace the bare `TODO` under `### Reflection` in `STUB_TEMPLATE` with a four-section scaffold: falsifiable claim, named blind spot, imagined-reader pushback, and conditional macro-Hansei with its triggers listed inline. This makes the required structure visible at stub generation time without requiring the agent to re-read SKILL.md step 6.

### Run 58 — 2026-05-01 — echo-sweep-silence

- **decided:** Silence. All active instruction surfaces are aligned with v3.8.0. The v3.8.0 echo propagation chain is complete: SKILL.md core (run 54) → step 7 fallback (run 55) → README user docs (run 56) → record.py stub (run 57) → full sweep clear (run 58).

### Run 59 — 2026-05-01 — zenodo-description-update

- **decided:** Update `.zenodo.json` description to match the six canonical steps of the loop.

### Run 60 — 2026-05-01 — tagline-step-names

- **decided:** Replace both occurrences of "Examine. Decide. Change. Verify. Record." (and "examine, decide, change, verify, record") with the accurate 7-step sequence: "Understand. Examine. Challenge. Decide. Act. Reflect. Record." (and lowercase equivalent in README table).

### Run 61 — 2026-05-01 — frontmatter-description-fix

- **decided:** Rewrite the frontmatter `description` sentence to: "Understand the ask, examine the target, challenge the first read, decide on one change (or argue for redesign, or declare silence), act, reflect on the target, and record." The USE WHEN tags are unchanged. The "Combines incremental refinement…" sentence is accurate and unchanged.

### Run 62 — 2026-05-01 — v381-patch-release

- **decided:** Cut v3.8.1: add CHANGELOG entry covering all seven post-v3.8.0 commits, bump README version line and CITATION.cff from 3.8.0 → 3.8.1. No skill-level version bumps warranted (no behavioral changes to any individual skill; step 7 fallback fix is a doc-only correction).

### Run 63 — 2026-05-01 — silence-run-63

- **decided:** Silence. No actionable finding. This is Anthropic silence peg 2 for the post-v3.8.1 state (peg 1 was run 58, which was post-v3.8.0 pre-description fixes; run 63 is the first clean peg on the fully updated v3.8.1 state).

### Run 64 — 2026-05-01 — feat-retrospect-skill

- **decided:** Create `retrospect/SKILL.md` as a new standalone arc-reflection skill. Update improve/SKILL.md step 6 to reference it. Propagate to all metadata surfaces.

### Run 65 — 2026-05-01 — feat-working-model

- **decided:** Add `.trail/model.md` as the working model artifact. Retrospect writes it (new step 5); Improve reads it at step 1; Trail documents it in the directory structure. Bump retrospect to v1.1.0, suite to v3.9.1.

### Run 66 — 2026-05-01 — docs-readme-retrospect.md-orientation

- **decided:** Fix the README "How it works" opening sentence to correctly describe the reading order introduced in run 65.

### Run 67 — 2026-05-01 — retrospect.md-seed-evo-vision

- **decided:** Seed `.trail/retrospect.md` from operator conversation. This is a bootstrap exception — normally retrospect.md is generated by a Retrospect arc-read. Seeding from conversation captures strategic insight that a trail-read alone would not produce. Future Retrospect runs will replace and update it.

### Run 68 — 2026-05-01 — split-vision-from-retrospect.md

- **decided:** Split orientation into two artifacts: `.trail/vision.md` (operator-held, stable, never written by any skill) and `.trail/retrospect.md` (Retrospect-derived, rewritten each run). Improve reads vision first, then retrospect.md, then trail. Vision is the destination; retrospect.md is the current location; trail is the path.

### Run 69 — 2026-05-01 — Vision-skill-added

- **decided:** Add a new sixth skill, Vision, with this contract:

### Run 70 — 2026-05-01 — Vision-on-operator-vision-intent

- **decided:** Apply Vision as designed: form 2-5 specific sourced hunches stated as guesses, turn each into a falsifiable question, surface one prioritized question (not all at once), do not write to vision.md without explicit operator approval. Three hunches formed:

### Run 71 — 2026-05-01 — position-md-v0-1-drafted

- **decided:** Draft POSITION.md as v0.1 with the following structure: open with the situation in plain language (no jargon, no field name), explain why existing labels miss it, name "operation-time trustworthy delegation" as the bet, define it via four sub-claims (operation-time / delegation / evidence-while-driving / protocol-not-tool), describe what I'm doing about it (the skills + workshop-and-proof setup) honestly including its limits, state what I'm NOT claiming, list 5 specific falsification criteria, sketch where this is going, mark as v0.1 provisional. Sign as the author. ~2200 words.

### Run 76 — 2026-05-02 — occasion-independence-experiment-pass-1

- **decided:** Question posed by agent: What mechanism prevents Improve from stalling on underspecified asks (continue/keep going/next) without waiting for the operator to inject a topic?

### Run 77 — 2026-05-02 — trail-v1-10-0-sessions-mandatory

- **decided:** Add a new "Writing the session file" section to trail/SKILL.md with: mandatory framing (not optional), filename convention (YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md), content template with fidelity label, session-file: link in log.md entry header, and git commit sequence. Change directory listing from "optional" to mandatory.

### Run 83 — 2026-05-03 — retrospect.md-claim6-operator-framing-correction

- **decided:** Fix retrospect.md claim 6: remove "operator != author" framing from the claim title, body, and next-runs queue item 1. Replace with operator-confirmed intent: a codebase the operator did not build, with the practical note that no such target is currently available. No structural or design change — this is a factual correction of a model-introduced constraint.

### Run 84 — 2026-05-03 — verify-session-file-enforcement

- **decided:** Add SESSION_FILE_META regex + check_session_files() function to verify.py. Call it from main(). Update docstring check list. Bump to v3.17.2; update CHANGELOG, README, CITATION.cff atomically.

### Run 85 — 2026-05-04 — rename-hunch-compass-plain-english-retrospect

- **decided:** TODO

### Run 86 — 2026-05-05 — rationalization-loop threat named; five mitigations queued

- **decided:** Do not implement the five mitigations in this conversation. Implementation is a substantial design pass that must go through a deliberate Improve run with the session file as input — running it as a side-effect of the conversation that proposed it would itself be an instance of the rationalization failure mode (acting before the prediction is locked).
- **decided:** Capture the conversation in a session file now, append this trail entry, and queue the design pass explicitly. The session file is the durable artifact; this log entry is the index pointer.

### Run 87 — 2026-05-05 — rationalization-loop-mitigations

- **decided:** Implement the core mitigations (1, 2, and 5) by updating SKILL.md specs for Improve, Trail, and Retrospect synchronously.

### Run 88 — 2026-05-05 — update-record-py-and-design-decision

- **decided:** Update STUB_TEMPLATE in 	ools/record.py to match the exact nomenclature of the updated 	rail/SKILL.md ("Prediction" and "Action and Outcome"). I will automatically inject the active session file reference into the header.

### Run 89 — 2026-05-05 — integrate-writer-split-and-adversarial-audit

- **decided:** Mutate the SKILL files to contain instructions for Writer Splitting and Adversarial Audit mode respectively, rather than scaffolding an entirely new skill file.

### Run 90 — 2026-05-05 — update-readme-mitigations-list

- **decided:** Update the README list to explicitly include Mitigations #4 (Adversarial Audit via Retrospect) and #3 (Separating Writer and Decider via High-Fidelity Mode).

### Run 91 — 2026-05-05 — improve-record-encoding-resilience

- **decided:** Update 	ools/record.py to use a safe reading wrapper with errors="replace" fallback logic instead of manually rewriting the log file to pure UTF-8.

### Run 95 — 2026-05-05 — improve-learning-gap

- **decided:** Add an explicit 4b. Extract operational rules (Learning) step to

### Run 96 — 2026-05-11 — improve-intent-composition

- **decided:** Fix intent/SKILL.md composition section — add one paragraph covering Vision and Retrospect. Rationale: when an agent loads the full suite, composition guidance was incomplete. Intent internally reads vision.md and retrospect.md in its step 2 but gave no signal about this. Two sentences close the gap without adding complexity.

### Run 97 — 2026-05-11 — improve-trail-integrity

- **decided:** Fix the trail integrity failures as the highest-leverage action. This involves repairing the encoding of corrupt files and creating placeholder stubs for missing session files. A trustworthy trail is the non-negotiable foundation of the entire system.

### Run 98 — 2026-05-11 — improve-probe-memory-model

- **decided:** Add the annotation to probe/SKILL.md.

### Run 99 — 2026-05-11 — improve-intent-remove-the-test

- **decided:** Remove "The Test" section. Fold para 2 as a closing test sentence into the Narrate step where it applies. Net effect: one fewer section, same useful guidance, better placement.

### Run 100 — 2026-05-11 — retrospect-run-2

- **decided:** TODO

### Run 101 — 2026-05-11 — improve-step6b-trigger-observability

- **decided:** Restructure step 6b so trigger evaluation is mandatory and evidence-bearing for every entry, while the macro reflection itself remains conditional on whether a trigger fired. Update tools/record.py STUB_TEMPLATE to pull future entries toward the new contract. Rationale: this is the smallest change that closes the structural gap retrospect named, without inventing a new skill or a new tool. Alternatives considered: (a) fix retrospect.md duplicated tail — rejected as the exact mechanical-cleanup pattern vision flags as the failure mode; (b) fill the abandoned `retrospect-run-2` stub — same rejection; (c) make macro-hansei mandatory every run — rejected as cost-disproportionate and signal-diluting; (d) build a tool that scans the trail and refuses entries when triggers fired but no macro section exists — argued for, but premature: the precondition is that the agent first start *recording* the evaluation. You cannot automate a check the trail has no shape for.

### Run 102 — 2026-05-11 — improve-trail-template-align

- **decided:** Update trail/SKILL.md Reflection template to encode the v3.8.0 contract; bump trail 1.11.0 → 1.12.0. Rationale: this completes the propagation of the prior structural change so it actually takes effect when agents follow trail/SKILL.md as the spec. Alternative considered and deferred: build the verify.py enforcement check (the imagined-reader pushback from the prior entry). Deferred because an enforcement check that contradicts the published spec creates pure friction — the template fix is the precondition. One change per run.

### Run 103 — 2026-05-11 — improve-verify-trigger-contract

- **decided:** Add `check_trigger_evaluation()` to verify.py. Scan entries from the contract slug onward; require all four trigger keywords (recurring, silence, contradict, operator) present in italicised labels; reject bare "N/A"/"TODO" as line content; require a `**Across-trail macro-Hansei**` subsection when any trigger contains "FIRED" not preceded by "not". Rationale: this is the structural pressure the prior two entries' imagined readers called for; without it, the v3.8.0 contract is decorative. Alternative considered and rejected: build the check as a pre-commit hook instead. Rejected because verify.py is the existing integrity surface and adding a parallel mechanism would split the audit story.

### Run 104 — 2026-05-11 — improve-learning-marker-access

- **decided:** |[!REALIZATION]|[!REVERSAL]' .trail/`". That guidance lives in the *trail* spec, not in the *improve* spec agents read before every run. The mechanism is documented in the wrong place.
- **decided:** Add one sentence to improve step 1's log.md bullet: name `[!REALIZATION]`/`[!REVERSAL]` markers as the efficient access path to learning residue when the log is long. Bump 3.8.0 → 3.8.1. Rationale: smallest change that makes vision's learning mechanism operational without a new tool or skill. The access path already exists in trail/SKILL.md; this puts it where agents look before every run.

### Run 105 — 2026-05-11 — improve-learning-artifact

- **decided:** Add `record.py learning [--write]` and `.trail/learning.md` as a derived compact artifact mirroring the history.md pattern. Update improve step 1 to read learning.md before log.md. Update trail/SKILL.md file map to document it. Bump improve 3.8.1 → 3.8.2 and trail 1.12.0 → 1.13.0.
- **decided:** ` markers too: bloats with choices that aren't learning residue. REALIZATION + REVERSAL is the learning content.

### Run 106 — 2026-05-11 — trail-derived-artifact-freshness

- **decided:** Update trail/SKILL.md to make derived-artifact regeneration mandatory at every commit, for both history.md and learning.md. Reconcile the "on-demand" prose for history.md with the multi-iteration block that already requires it. Bump 1.13.0 → 1.14.0. tools/record.py needs no changes.

### Run 107 — 2026-05-11 — improve-marker-integrity

- **decided:** Three-part change: (1) record.py MARKER regex — remove `^` anchor, change `.match()` to `.search()`. (2) verify.py: add `check_derived_artifact_freshness()` using mtime comparison. (3) verify.py: refactor `check_session_files()` to use `_parse_entries()` helper.

### Run 108 — 2026-05-11 — retrospect-after-marker-integrity

- **decided:** Replace `.trail/retrospect.md` with arc-claims focused on three meta-shifts: (1) the centre-of-gravity shift to trail epistemics, now load-bearing for ~25 entries; (2) the artifact-symmetry of the three pillars now being structurally complete; (3) the operator-gate pattern as the empirical strategic engine. Plus an adversarial-audit observation: the 2:118 reversal-to-realization ratio is implausibly low and signals likely under-use of `[!REVERSAL]`.

### Run 109 — 2026-05-11 — improve-offer-next-moves

- **decided:** Add step 6c "Offer next moves" to improve/SKILL.md (v3.9.0). Add a corresponding optional `### Candidate next moves` subsection to the trail entry template in trail/SKILL.md (v1.15.0) and to the stub generated by tools/record.py. Keep the step explicitly informal: the operator may pick, redirect, or ignore the ranking.
- **REVERSAL:** `. The retrospect named this as a likely confabulation pattern; closing it is structural, not cosmetic.

### Run 110 — 2026-05-11 — improve-reversal-honesty

- **decided:** Three small edits in one iteration: (1) tighten the `[!REVERSAL]` definition in trail/SKILL.md to explicitly include within-iteration backouts, with an example. (2) add a single-sentence prompt in improve/SKILL.md step 5. (3) create `.gitignore` and untrack the pyc.
- **REVERSAL:** ` definition in trail/SKILL.md says "A decision made and then undone." That is technically inclusive of within-iteration backouts but is being read as "reversing a prior run." Evidence: today's `check_non_canonical_markers` was attempted, produced 46 false positives, removed — narrated in the iter 7 entry, not marked. The author did not see the narration as a reversal. The definition needs an explicit clause naming both kinds.
- **REVERSAL:** ` if any occurs. The next Retrospect will be able to compare narrated-but-unmarked vs marked reversals across the arc and report whether the gap closed. Will NOT cause artificial inflation of reversal density — most iterations don't have within-iteration backouts; the rate stays a function of the work, not the prompt.
- **REVERSAL:** ` definition now reads "Both kinds count: reversing a prior run's decision, *and* backing out of a step planned earlier in the same iteration." Example block gained a within-iteration example drawn from iter 7 of today's sweep. improve/SKILL.md step 5 gained a final paragraph naming the under-marking pattern explicitly as a confabulation signal. `.gitignore` created with `__pycache__/`, `*.pyc`, `*.pyo`; the previously-tracked pyc was untracked via `git rm --cached`.
- **REVERSAL:** `? The number is the baseline; the next 5 iterations after this one should show the gap closing.

### Run 111 — 2026-05-11 — audit-reversal-density-and-frame-vision-gap

- **decided:** No code/spec changes this iteration. The entry itself is the artifact: audit numbers, partial refutation of the retrospect's claim, framed question for #3. Rejected: implementing an autonomous Retrospect trigger directly — that is a destination decision for the operator (Vision territory), not an Improve change.
- **REVERSAL:** ` text occurrences (most are mentions in prose: "the [!REVERSAL] marker", "Contradicts prior [!REVERSAL]")
- **REVERSAL:** ` markers but no narrated-pattern hit, and 1 that has both. The 7 marker-only entries may contain reversal narrations my patterns missed (e.g., "instead of X, did Y" or "this approach didn't work"). The "1 narrated-but-unmarked" finding is therefore a *lower bound*, not a complete count. A more thorough audit would manually read each entry's narrative.

### Run 112 — 2026-05-11 — probe-operator-gate-reasoning

- **decided:** The probe verdict is PASS.

### Run 113 — 2026-05-12 — improve-retrospect-freshness-guard

- **decided:** Backfill the missing session file to preserve append-only trail history, then add a process-level freshness gate to Retrospect (step 1b) instead of relying only on post-hoc verify failures.

### Run 114 — 2026-05-12 — retrospect-freshness-simulation

- **decided:** Record the simulation as an evidence-only trail entry with its own session file, then regenerate derived artifacts and re-run verify.

### Run 115 — 2026-05-12 — improve-retrospect-freshness-checklist

- **decided:** Add a short mandatory execution checklist plus one minimal filled example directly under step 1b in retrospect/SKILL.md.

### Run 116 — 2026-05-12 — distribution-enforcement-discoverability

- **decided:** Build a four-layer enforcement+distribution stack rather than expand the Improve skill. Improve remains a discipline; structural concerns belong in tools and CI.
- **decided:** Declare silence on #4 voice consistency - the six SKILL.md openings already share structure and tone. Manufacturing edits would be the manufactured-finding failure mode the principles warn against.

### Run 117 — 2026-05-12 — docs-changelog-for-v3.18.0

- **decided:** Prepend the v3.18.0 release notes to the changelog. This is a standard documentation step before tagging a release.

### Run 118 — 2026-05-12 — cross-repo-positioning-alignment

- **decided:** Do one coordinated pass across both repos: align top-level framing, align canonical URLs/metadata, and trail both repos in the same session before commit.

### Run 119 — 2026-05-13 — trail-file-rename-audit-trail

- **decided:** Hard-cut rename. File: `git mv .trail/log.md .trail/audit-trail.md`. Skill name unchanged. No legacy fallback. Rationale: every other skill produces an artifact whose name names the skill (vision.md, retrospect.md); `log.md` was the lone generic outlier. Rejected: keep `log.md` and add a doc note ("the trail is in log.md") — that is exactly the indirection the operator named as the cost.

### Run 120 — 2026-05-13 — sync-principles-from-manifesto

- **decided:** Overwrite skills PRINCIPLES.md with manifesto HEAD, rewriting ./PROBLEM.md and ./PROOF.md links to canonical GitHub URLs. No other changes.

### Run 121 — 2026-05-22 — vision-sourced-inference-reframe

- **decided:** Change Step 2: rename "Form hunches" → "Form sourced inferences", add a one-paragraph acknowledgment of the structural tension (agent narrating intent superficially resembles the failure mode the framework prevents) and name the safeguard (evidence-tracing + two-level operator adjudication: operator can reject the evidence-reading OR the conclusion independently). Tighten the "Sourced" bullet to require a specific citation (quoted phrase, trail entry by date+slug, concrete exchange) rather than "briefly state what gave you this vision." Propagate vocabulary change through Step 5, Step 6, and "What this skill does not do."
